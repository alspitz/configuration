# configuration
A collection of scripts and configuration files I like to use.

.stickycd can be sourced from your bashrc and any new terminal will open
in your previously cd'ed directory.

icewm/ contains my preferences and key bindings for the icewm window manager.

brightness allows you to manually adjust your backlight brightness.

charge prints out the percentage of your laptop battery life remaining.

killwindow allows you to instantly kill any window by clicking on it.

mvlatest moves the last item to be downloaded to your current directory.

Your mileage will definitely vary!
